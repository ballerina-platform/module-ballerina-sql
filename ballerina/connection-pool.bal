# Represents the properties which are used to configure DB connection pool.
# Default values of the fields can be set through the configuration API.
#
# + maxOpenConnections - The maximum number of open connections that the pool is allowed to have including
#                        both idle and in-use connections. The default value is 15. This can be changed through the
#                        configuration API with the `ballerina.sql.maxOpenConnections` key
# + maxConnectionLifeTime - The maximum lifetime (in seconds) of a connection in the pool. The default value is 1800
#                           seconds (30 minutes). This can be changed through the configuration API with the
#                           `ballerina.sql.maxConnectionLifeTime` key. A value of 0 indicates an unlimited maximum
#                           lifetime (infinite lifetime)
# + minIdleConnections - The minimum number of idle connections that the pool tries to maintain in it. The default value
#                        is the same as `maxOpenConnections` and it can be changed through the configuration
#                        API with the `ballerina.sql.minIdleConnections` key
